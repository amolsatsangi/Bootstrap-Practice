    <p class="text-truncate">Chapter 5 introduces probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms. We typically
        use probabilistic analysis to determine the running time of an algorithm in
        cases in which, due to the presence of an inherent probability distribution, the
        running time may differ on different inputs of the same size. In some cases, we
        assume that the inputs conform to a known probability distribution, so that we are
        averaging the running time over all possible inputs. In other cases, the probability
        distribution comes not from the inputs but from random choices made during the
        course of the algorithm. An algorithm whose behavior is determined not only by its
        input but by the values produced by a random-number generator is a randomized
        algorithm.</p>
